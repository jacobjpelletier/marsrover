A. Functional Programming Intro
    1. Why Do I need FP?
        a. First and probably most importantly, having a solid understanding of another programming paradigm will help
            you write better code - even if you never end up using a functional language or framework in your job.
        b. It is on the rise, more languages are choosing at least functional-inspired styles, and understanding where
           these ideas are coming from will help you learn them faster
        c. It will make learning React less mysterious. React and Redux both heavily ascribe to functional principles.

        b. Variable values cannot be edited, but.. functions can return new values.
        c. Programs can be expressed completely with... chains of functions and inputs
        d. Functions... have no effct except the values they return
        e. Dr. Church described programs as assembly lines of functions that... are like black boxes, you cannot
            see the logic inside
